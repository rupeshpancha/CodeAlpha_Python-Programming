# CodeAlpha_Python-Programming

A simple, beginner-friendly Hangman game written in Python.

**How It Works**
1. The game chooses a random word from a small list (apple, banana, cherry, orange, grape).
2. The player guesses letters one at a time.
3. Correct guesses reveal the letters in the word.
4. Wrong guesses reduce your remaining tries (you get 6 in total).
5. The game ends when:
6. You guess all the letters correctly, or
7.You run out of tries.
