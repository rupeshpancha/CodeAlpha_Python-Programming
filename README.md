# CodeAlpha_Python-Programming
**task1**
A simple, beginner-friendly Hangman game written in Python.

**How It Works**
1. The game chooses a random word from a small list (apple, banana, cherry, orange, grape).
2. The player guesses letters one at a time.
3. Correct guesses reveal the letters in the word.
4. Wrong guesses reduce your remaining tries (you get 6 in total).
5. The game ends when:
6. You guess all the letters correctly, or
7.You run out of tries.


**task2**
A small Python program that lets you check the total value of your stock holdings. This project is just a basic, console-based tool 
**What This Program Does**
1. Lets you enter a stock symbol (like AAPL, TSLA, etc.)
2. Uses a hardcoded dictionary of stock prices
3. Asks how many shares you own
4. Calculates the cost and adds it to your total
5. Shows your final investment value when you're done
6. Lets you save the result to a text file



**task3**

This is a small Python chatbot I made to understand how basic rule-based logic works. It runs in the terminal and responds to a few predefined messages. Nothing fancy—just a beginner-friendly project to practice conditionals, loops, and simple text processing.

**What the Chatbot Can Do**
The bot checks your message and replies based on simple if/elif rules:

User Message                Bot Reply
hello                       Hi!             
how are you	                I'm fine, thanks!
bye	                        Goodbye!
anything else	Sorry,        I don't understand that.
